# Car_Barrier
Example Link: https://youtu.be/Hl5pw7Z0eH4 

• This simulates the entrance in parking area, using Arduino atmega328p.

• Developed a servo motor that "opens" the barrier when the correct code is entered on the keypad, then servo returns when an object has passed (using PIR-sensor), but if something stands below the barrier (using Ultrasonic-sensor), servo stops and rises (try until safe). Each passing "car" increments the 7-segment-display.
